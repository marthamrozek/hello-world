# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
My goal is to learn and master various different programming languages such as; Java, Python, C++, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, Java Script. 
I aim to use GitHub as a way for me to keep my code organized, and be able to visually see my progress and connect with others who have similar goals and interests.
